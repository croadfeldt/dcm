# DCM

DCM (Data Center Management) is envisioned as a framework designed to provide a "hyperscaler-like cloud experience" for on-premises infrastructure. It aims to centralize and automate the management, observation, and lifecycle of IT/IS services within an enterprise data center. This is a work in progress with the initial stage of HLD documentation completed. Detailed specifications and discussions are on-going. Expertise and opinions are encouraged and welcome.
  
## Core Principles & Goals:
  
* **Centralized Management**: Consolidate disparate automation efforts under a single control plane or "single pane of glass" to manage various data center components.
* **Automation & Self-Service**: Leverage existing automation tools (like Ansible Automation Platform) to offer a self-service model for provisioning, configuration, and day-to-day management. The goal is to enable application teams to define and deploy infrastructure as code.
* **Declarative Infrastructure**: Define the desired state of infrastructure, with the system working to achieve and maintain that state, aiding in reconciliation between discovered and intended inventory.
* **Composability**: Emphasize a composable architecture that allows for reusable services and operational efficiencies.
* **Technology Agnostic Framework**: Designed to be flexible and consume common data formats, translating them to appropriate technologies, though an opinionated model is available.
* **Full Lifecycle Management**: Enable complete lifecycle management of IT/IS services and ephemeral/declarative infrastructure.
* **Mimics Kubernetes Design**: Draws inspiration from Kubernetes' orchestration and declarative control plane.
* **API First**: All integrations are done via a common API framework.
* **AI Ready**: DCM is standalone, but designed with AI in mind as core components and AIOps layered over the top.
