DCM (Data Center Management) is envisioned as a framework designed to provide a "hyperscaler-like cloud experience" for on-premises infrastructure. It aims to centralize and automate the management, observation, and lifecycle of IT/IS services within an enterprise data center.

Here's an architectural overview of DCM, based on the provided documents:

**Core Principles & Goals:**

* **Centralized Management**: Consolidate disparate automation efforts under a single control plane or "single pane of glass" to manage various data center components.  
* **Automation & Self-Service**: Leverage existing automation tools (like Ansible Automation Platform) to offer a self-service model for provisioning, configuration, and day-to-day management. The goal is to enable application teams to define and deploy infrastructure as code.  
* **Declarative Infrastructure**: Define the desired state of infrastructure, with the system working to achieve and maintain that state, aiding in reconciliation between discovered and intended inventory.  
* **Composability**: Emphasize a composable architecture that allows for reusable services and operational efficiencies.  
* **Technology Agnostic Framework**: Designed to be flexible and consume common data formats, translating them to appropriate technologies, though an opinionated model is available.  
* **Full Lifecycle Management**: Enable complete lifecycle management of IT/IS services and ephemeral/declarative infrastructure.  
* **Mimics Kubernetes Design**: Draws inspiration from Kubernetes' orchestration and declarative control plane.

**Key Architectural Components:**

1. **Centralized Data Model**:  
   * **Nature**: Git-based, flexible, and transformable.  
   * **Purpose**: Contains entity definitions for governance, metadata, location-specific, and application-specific data.  
   * **Consumption**: Designed to be consumed by various tools like Terraform and Ansible.  
   * **Storage**: Must be stored in a Git repository, potentially using a YAML format mimicking Kubernetes.  
   * **Rules**: Employs concepts like host entities, base entities, layer entities (for changes and overrides), and realized entities (widgets).  
2. **API-Driven Interface**:  
   * **Core Design**: Everything within DCM is intended to be an API service, enabling consistent interaction.  
3. **Automation Platform**:  
   * **Core Engine**: DCM is intended to be vendor agnostic, the framework will define the roles, resposibilities, interactions, and expected capabilities. This will allow organizations to implement the tools of their choice and still ensure interoperability.
   * **Repository**: This is an integration detail which will be part of an opinated implementation.
   * **Integrations**: This is an integration detail which will be part of an opinated implementation.
4. **Service Catalog**:  
   * **Functionality**: Provides a product catalog for service provisioning and management, enabling users to request and consume IT/IS services.  
5. **Orchestration and Workflow Engine**:  
   * **Components**: Includes workflow orchestration capabilities, a request processor, and an execution plane.  
   * **Process**: Handles service requests, potentially involving entitlement verification, budget checks, and resource availability before executing the provisioning or management tasks. (e.g., "Request New MongoDB Cluster" example workflow shows request payload, entitlement verification, and sub-requests like new VM provisioning).  
6. **Centralized Core Services**:  
   * **Includes**: Service provisioning, governance, observability, request processing, and centralized logging.  
   * **Inventory**: As part of the operation of the DCM data model, an inventory system of truth will be exposed along with extensive meta data, allowing for emergent capabilities such as auditing, data correlation, inventory system of truth, risk modeling, etc...
7. **Extensive extendability**:
   * **Functionality**: Due to the API first, unified data model and extensive meta data, adding new capabilities to DCM is straight forward and consice.

  

**Interaction Flow (Conceptual):**

1. **User Request**: An application team or end-user requests a service via the self-service portal/API (e.g., "Request New MongoDB Cluster").  
2. **Request Processor**: The request is received and processed, including checks for authorization, budget, and resource availability.  
3. **Service Manifest**: The request is translated into a service manifest, leveraging the centralized data model.  
4. **Orchestration**: The orchestration engine takes the service manifest and coordinates various atomic services to fulfill the request.  
5. **Execution Plane**: The automation platform, aka service provider, executes the necessary automation to provision and configure the infrastructure and services.  
6. **Inventory Update**: The inventory is updated to reflect the deployed resources, and realization mechanisms to ensure the deployed state matches the intended state.  
7. **Observability**: Centralized logging and observability tools provide insights into the deployed services and infrastructure.

**Comparison and Evolution**:

The architecture acknowledges lessons learned from previous efforts like CloudForms, aiming for a robust implementation that avoids past pitfalls while retaining valid design goals. It also seeks to integrate existing internal tools and certified collections, building upon existing automation efforts rather than reinventing them.
